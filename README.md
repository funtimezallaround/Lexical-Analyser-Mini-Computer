# Lexical-Analyser-Mini-Computer
## A small program which accepts short phrases according to a set of rules and gives an output accordingly.
The main rule is that a input must contain an instruction (add, sub, mult, div, concat) followed by two comma separated values and ending in a please, with a space between the 3 main sections. An example would be: add 3,2 please.
The program can also handle 2 irregular requests, to ask for the rules and to exit running, which do not have the comma separated values. An example of this exception is: rules please.
